Dan Hendricks and I worked together

WASD to move camera in respective direction
Left click on an orange tile to select start node
Right click on an orange tile to select end node
Mouse Wheel click (and drag) to make path tiles an obstacle (extra credit)
Mouse Wheel up and down to zoom in and out respectively
Press Spacebar over an orange tile to make it a waypoint

Click on the buttons to start A* or to change what is indicated.

It takes some time to load the map and calculate A* if you choose
two nodes very far away. It doesn't take more than 10 seconds.


Thank you so much for the 2 day extension. Sorry for being a day late. We had 
and exam on day 1 and a project due on day 2.
